This is a repo for the SER 516 Project 1 <br />
This is a sample change to test the github and slack integration. <br />

NOTE:

If you want to test Task #72 under user story #29. You will need a slack App installed in any one of the channel. In this task we are pushing the add/remove committers notifications to a slack channel. We've put placeholders in the code, update the webhook.json file with the webhook URL and make sure the APP is installed in the slack channel.  We have a working setup for this channel. Please reach out to us if you want to get added to the working setup. We will invite you to the slack workspace.
